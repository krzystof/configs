# Configs

A convenient repo to copy and get common projects configs.

Link the `getconfig.sh`:

```sh
ln -s ${PWD}/getconfig.sh ~/.local/bin/getconfig
```

Download a config file from this repo:

```sh
getconfig eslint
```

That will `wget` the `.eslintrc.js` file from the repo into the current4 directory.
